    <h2>Exercise Child allowance</h2>
    <p>
        A mother is entitled to € 25.00 child allowance per child.  She will receive a supplement of €12.50 for the third child (and each subsequent child).  For the fifth (and each subsequent) child, she will receive an additional allowance of €7.50.  If the mother's monthly wage is less than or equal to €500.00, she will receive a 25% surcharge on the child benefit.  But if her monthly wage is greater than €2000.00, she will receive 25% less child benefit.  A mother is always entitled to a minimum of €25.00 per child.  Question: Read in the number of children and monthly wages, and show the child benefit to which the mother is entitled.  (For example, 6 children and € 500.00 monthly wage gives € 215.00 child benefit).
